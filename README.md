# Chemtrail Fighter

A fun HTML5 canvas game where you clean up chemtrails with your tinfoil hat cursor!

## Game Description

In Chemtrail Fighter, planes fly across the sky leaving chemtrails behind. Your mission is to clean up these chemtrails using your tinfoil hat cursor. The more trails you clean, the more points you earn. Use your points to upgrade your tinfoil hat's size, style, and speed.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click "Spiel starten" (Start Game) to begin
3. Move your mouse cursor (which appears as a tinfoil hat) over the chemtrails to clean them up
4. Earn points for each trail you clean
5. Use your points to purchase upgrades at the top of the screen:
   - Größer (Bigger): Increases the size of your tinfoil hat
   - Stil (Style): Changes the appearance of your tinfoil hat
   - Schneller (Faster): Increases your cleaning speed
6. Be careful! If too many chemtrails accumulate (covering more than 20% of the screen), you'll lose the game
